# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning_Linear-Regression

This project demonstrates a simple Linear Regression model using Python to analyze the relationship between weekly self-study hours and student performance. The workflow includes:
•	Importing and visualizing the dataset
•	Splitting into training and testing sets (70:30)
•	Building and training a regression model
•	Evaluating performance using R², MAE, MSE, and RMSE
•	Visualizing results for better insights
